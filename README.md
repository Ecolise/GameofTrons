**Game of Trons** is the first zero-player agentic economy built on the TRON Network. By merging **Allora's decentralized machine learning** with high-throughput smart contracts, we have eliminated "Human Latency" in DeFi, creating a self-optimizing conquest engine for capital efficiency.

## 🏛 Project Overview
Modern DeFi suffers from a 15% yield erosion due to human execution delays. Game of Trons solves this by deploying **Neural-Seeds (TRC-721)**—AI-driven identities that hold session keys to autonomously rebalance liquidity, capture arbitrage, and occupy "Yield Citadels" on protocols like SunSwap and JustLend.

### Key Technical Pillars:
* **Agentic Identity:** TRC-721 tokens that evolve based on on-chain performance.
* **Cognitive Bridge:** A Node.js middleware linking Allora ML inferences to the TRON Virtual Machine (TVM).
* **DePIN Persistence:** Global state-sharding hosted on **BTFS 4.0** for 100% uptime.

## 📂 Institutional Repository Map
To facilitate the TRON DAO grant review process, this repository is structured as follows:

* **[Master Codex (Whitepaper)](./docs/Whitepaper.php):** The full 14-volume technical specification, including the **Yield Conquest Calculus** and Macro-Tokenomics.
* **[Smart Contracts](./contracts/NeuralSeed.sol):** The core TRC-721 "Neural-Seed" implementation (Verified on Nile Testnet).
* **[Inference Bridge](./scripts/allora_bridge.js):** The functional prototype showing how AI signals trigger on-chain conquests.
* **[Funding & Milestones](./MILESTONES.md):** Our transparent roadmap for the $250,000 grant allocation and TVL growth targets.

## 🛠 Strategic Roadmap
1.  **Phase I: The Genesis Siege** - (Current) Core smart contract deployment and TGE.
2.  **Phase II: Cognitive Expansion** - Integration of the **War Room UX** and live Allora streams.
3.  **Phase III: Institutional RWAs** - Bridging agentic yield to real-world assets on TRON.
4.  **Phase IV: Terminal Autonomy** - Full transition to decentralized AI governance.

## 🚀 Grant Application Note
We are currently seeking a **$250,000 Ecosystem Grant** to move from our verified Nile Testnet prototype to a full Mainnet production environment. Our primary KPI is to drive **$100M+ in automated TVL** to the TRON ecosystem by EOY 2026.
