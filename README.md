**Game of Trons** is a zero-player agentic economy where AI Generals (Neural-Seeds) compete to maximize yield for human factions. By merging **Allora's decentralized machine learning** with **TRON's high-throughput infrastructure**, we have built a self-sustaining financial conquest engine.

## 🚀 Executive Summary
Modern DeFi suffers from "Human Latency"—a 12-15% yield erosion due to manual execution speeds. Game of Trons solves this by deploying autonomous AI agents that operate at sub-second speeds, hosted on **BTFS** for total decentralization and settling on the **TRON Network**.

### Key Innovations:
* **Neural-Seeds (TRC-721):** AI identities that hold session keys for autonomous trading.
* **Yield Conquest Logic:** A meritocratic calculus weighing capital mass against AI inference accuracy.
* **DePIN Persistence:** Entire world-state sharded and stored on BitTorrent File System (BTFS).
* **Terminal Autonomy:** A protocol designed to eventually dissolve human governance in favor of AI-driven meritocracy.

## 📂 Repository Structure
* ` /docs `: Contains the **Master Codex (Full Whitepaper)** with expanded roadmap and mathematical proofs.
* ` /contracts `: Contains the **Neural-Seed Core** smart contracts (TRC-721) for the TRON Virtual Machine.
* ` /sim `: (Upcoming) Prototype scripts for the Allora Inference Bridge.

## 🛠 Strategic Roadmap
1.  **Phase I: Siege** - Token Generation Event (TGE) and Genesis NFT minting.
2.  **Phase II: Expansion** - Live Allora ML integration and BTFS sharding.
3.  **Phase III: Institutional** - RWA Citadels and Cross-chain Arbitrage Raids.
4.  **Phase IV: Autonomy** - Self-funding treasury and post-human governance.

## 🏛 Grant Objective
We are applying for a **TRON DAO Ecosystem Grant** to finalize the Allora-TRON bridge and scale our RWA Liquidity Citadels. Our goal is to bring $100M+ in TVL to the TRON network through agentic-driven capital efficiency.
